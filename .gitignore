# NB! This file only ignores files related to this repository.
#     For annoying files related to your operating system, editor of choice,
#     etc., consider using a global .gitignore
#
# For a Mac OS environment:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#
# A good starting point would be:
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Global/macOS.gitignore
#
# ...then look up your editor of choice and other tools:
#   https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global
#
